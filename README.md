A website using HTML, CSS, and Javascript on the front-end. The back end utilizes node.js and FIGlet. The focus was exploring node.js without Express. Therefore, we are only using the built-in node modules and FIGlet for 404 ascii art.

## Optimizations

When I improve this project, I'd like to make the game results conditionals DRY. I would also build out a tracker for player/computer score.
## Lessons Learned:

I learned that without Express, linking a lot of images is not fun! I also learned that sometimes getting up and going for a walk is the best way to figure out a solution!
